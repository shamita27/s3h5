  utter_stopped heart:
   - text: "Here are few steps to follow:
   - 1. Find a person nearby. Make eye contact, point to them, and say: Call 108.
   - 2. Start doing chest compressions on the person who needs help. Using both your hands, push down hard and fast in the center of the person’s chest. Let their chest come back up naturally between compressions. You may hear pops or snaps; this is normal.
   - 3. Keep going until someone with more training arrives.
   - 4. If you are trained in CPR, you can use chest compressions and rescue breathing.
   - 5. Do not remove the cloth if it becomes soaked. Removing the first layer will interfere with the clotting process and result in more blood loss. Instead, add more layers if needed.

   - 3. Castor Oil: Castor oil is often used in eye drops to provide relief from eye irritation. It is a naturopathic method used to treat many different conditions including sore eyes.
   - 4. Essential Oils:Essential oils should not be used or applied anywhere near the eye.
